# DataWhisperer - Interact With Your Dataset
<hr />

DataWhisperer is an open-source website tool developed in
Python. It is used to automate any classic ML task like 
regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality
reduction, or ranking. It can automate basic data cleaning
and preprocessing techniques, provide all required data
visualization column-wise, find the best model for the
dataset, train the model, and display the training and
testing results.

The most interesting feature in the website is the ability
to generate fundamental patterns and insights about the
dataset.

## Features
- Automate the process of data preprocessing.
- Perform basic visualizing tasks, to check for various feature properties.
- Find and select the best model for the task and the dataset.
- Train, test and validation the accuracy for the model.
- Find basic insights like linear seperability, feature importance.
- Advanced insights like hierarchies, associate rules, frequent item-set mining.
